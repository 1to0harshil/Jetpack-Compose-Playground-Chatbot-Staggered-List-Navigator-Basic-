# Jetpack-Compose-Playground-Chatbot-Staggered-List-Navigator-Basic-

This repository provides a foundational Android project built using Jetpack Compose, offering a
practical exploration of:

**Chatbot Integration**:
Interact with a chatbot through API calls, demonstrating communication with
external services.
**Staggered ListView**: Efficiently display content in a visually appealing, asymmetrical layout
suitable for various data types.
**Basic Navigation**: Implement rudimentary navigation patterns to guide users through different
screens
within the app.
This project serves as a launchpad for you to build upon and experiment with Jetpack Compose's
capabilities. Feel free to tailor and expand upon these features to create your own unique
applications
